    Hotel Management System (Programming 1 Project). 
The Hotel Management System facilitates the hotel room booking process through making a reservation, accessing information on reserved or unreserved rooms and outputting information detailing the amenities offered by the rooms.  

Offered me the challenge of working with object-oriented programming concepts and layers of conditional statements 

Utilizes Class Objects to store booking information 

Navigating displayed menus is handled by various control flow statements 

Several data types are used to store and access data 

   Future Improvements
-  Include SFML graphics library to display a map of hotel
-  More modular object design, replace room class with booking class
-  Include output of receipt text file
-  More organized menu output
-  Adhere to best function, variable and class style practices
-  Improved commenting
